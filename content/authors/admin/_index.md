I'm a doctor and researcher working with people affected by amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or motor neuron disease). We use scanning and recording techniques (MRI, MEG, TMS) to map brain and spinal cord activity. This will hopefully lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment. I work at the University of Oxford, supervised by Prof. Martin Turner and Prof. Charlotte Stagg. I am funded by the Association of British Neurologists and the Dunhill Medical Trust.
